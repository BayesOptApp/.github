# BayesOptApp: Advancing Bayesian Optimization inspired by Applications 

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the **BayesOptApp** GitHub organization! Our mission is to advance **Bayesian Optimization (BO)**, drawing inspiration from real-world applied challenges. At the moment, we focus on tackling the complexities of **high-dimensional search spaces, constrained optimization, mixed-variable domains**, and other complex problem settings where standard BO struggles.

## About Us  

BayesOptApp is led by **Dr. Elena Raponi**, Assistant Professor at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), Leiden University. This organization would not be possible without the contributions of **Ivan Olarte Rodriguez, Maria Laura Santoni**, and the many **students of Leiden University**, who take on the challenge of gettinf familiar and advancing BO within their thesis projects.  

We aim to bridge the gap between **theory and practice**, developing new methodologies while also demonstrating their impact on **engineering design, optimization under uncertainty, and complex real-world applications**.

## What You'll Find Here  

This organization hosts repositories for both:  
- **Fundamental research** on novel Bayesian Optimization methodologies.  
- **Application-driven studies** solving practical optimization challenges.
